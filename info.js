//FAMILY/TYPE INFO
redInfo = "Reds are deeply <i>people-oriented</i>. They are always making plans, seeking quality time with friends and family, and making an effort to meet new people. With a warm, welcoming presence, reds will not have trouble making connections.<br><br>You might find reds working as a children's entertainer, a community organizer, a DJ, or a religious leader. They will always make a big impact on others' lives.";
orangeInfo = "Oranges are the most <i>well-rounded</i> color family. As the true warm color family, they have a balanced and extroverted personality that lets them connect meaningfully with others while maintaining a thriving personal life. Oranges are always developing new skills and taking on new hobbies. They are inspired by genuine curiosity for the world around them and they love to learn. <br><br>Oranges may be writers, podcast hosts, wedding photographers, or astronauts. They will inspire others with their open hearts and mature minds.";
yellowInfo = "Yellows are the most <i>joyful</i> color family. Known for being bubbly and optimistic, they're not one-dimensional and have a more analytical side as well. Yellows often have a rich personal history; many people may not understand the journey it took for them to get to where they are today. <br><br>Yellows might be cartoonists, restaurant hosts, motivational speakers, or dance instructors. They will always have a kind word for a friend and a smile for a stranger.";
greenInfo = "Greens are a <i>peaceful</i> color type that bridge the gap between cool and warm. With the contentedness of yellows and the emotional intelligence of blues, greens may seem to have it all; they do, however, struggle with compromising their understated nature with the busyness of modern life. <br><br>Greens might be yoga instructors, baristas, homemakers, carpenters, or farmers. They often will fulfill the role of peacekeepers in their personal or professional lives.";
blueInfo = "Blues are the most <i>emotionally intelligent</i> color family. As the true cool family, they need plenty of time alone and they highly value the power of introspection. They are cherished for their wisdom and unique ability to understand how people tick.<br><br>Blues may be therapists, stay-at-home parents, musicians, museum curators, or park rangers. Although it may take them a while to form bonds, they are a valuable presence in others' lives.";
purpleInfo = "Purples are the most <i>unusual</i> color family. Purples hold a true whimsy and curiosity for the world that isn't present in most adults. While buttoned-up types may find Purples to be childish or unserious, they delight those who are open-minded enough to appreciate their quirks.<br><br>Purples may be comedy writers, trapeze artists, explorers, filmmakers, or multihyphenates with too many professions to list. They will contribute great amounts to arts and cultureâ€” if they choose to share their gifts with the world."; 
outlierInfo = "Outliers are the <i>rarest</i> color family. The Outlier family includes only the white and black types, which may sound like opposites but are united by an unconventional outlook on the world and a cutting intelligence.<br><br>These types are true mavericks: they may end up as revolutionaries, trendsetters, hermits, world leaders, inventors, or criminals. They have the potential for great good and great harm.";

lightRedInfo =  "You are constantly seeking out new connections and new places. You might have a penchant for romantic connections, and you value living through as many unique experiences as possible. Light Red is a relatively controversial color type: cool and dark types may think you are shallow or flighty. But many people, especially light and warm types, will find you energizing. Unlike many types, you will get along well with others of your type." +

"<li><b>Notes of:</b> clover, green apple, peppermint</li></ul>";
darkGreenInfo = "Perhaps the most introverted color type, dark greens know what's important in life.

While you have a circle of close friends who know the real you, you're also one of the most popular color types because of your entertaining personality. Light purples can be some of the funniest and most creative people around; however, you may struggle with feeling like a persona and worrying that people don't truly know you." +

"<li><b>Notes of:</b> fig, grape soda, purple cabbage</li></ul>";
darkPurpleInfo = "Dark purples are true individualists who live fully off the beaten path. You may have a wild fashion sense, exotic pets, or life experiences that could make a bestselling movie. You're a bit of a hidden gem amongst their social circle: friends exchange anecdotes they learn about you and excitedly introduce you as one of the most interesting people they know. Dark purples have no desire for showiness: you are always authentic." +

//outliers
whiteInfo = "A thoroughly multi-faceted person, you will evoke a wide array of responses from others: much like a white-colored surface, you reflect other's personalities back at them. You are able to fit into nearly any situation and have many skills. You form meaningful connections with mature, grounded types such as cool darks and true tones. You will quickly notice two-faced or manipulative behavior in people, often far before others do." +

"<li><b>Notes of:</b> fog, blank paper, frosted glass</li></ul>";

blackInfo = "You are a pragmatist with an intensely realistic, utilitarian sensibility. Black color types, defined by the <i>absence</i> of color, often harbor very few material desires or surface-level thoughts. These types are able to have a focused mind and see the deepest truths in people. This makes black one of the most controversial color types: people may feel disconcerted by their lack of pleasantries and their ability to see right through others." +
